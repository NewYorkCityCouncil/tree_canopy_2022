list.of.packages <- c("tidyverse", "janitor")

# checks if packages has been previously installed
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]

# if not, packages are installed
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)

# packages are loaded
lapply(list.of.packages, require, character.only = TRUE)
